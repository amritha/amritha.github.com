<h3>Summary:</h3>
</div>

I worked at Cisco Systems from July 2010 to September 2011 as an Interaction Designer. The project I designed for was Cisco Quad, an enterprise collaboration platform, and I owned the interaction for the Discussion Forum and My Library features. </p>

<p>My major responsibilities:</p>
<div id="post">
<ul>
	<li>I created wireframes using Omnigraffle and Adobe Fireworks to illustrate complex interaction flows for my assigned target areas in order to iterate and improve the overall usability of the product.</li>
	<li>I simultaneously participated in multiple scrum teams as the User Experience Lead to ensure that code implementation matched design specifications.</li>
	<li>I created high fidelity interaction prototypes based on design specifications using Adobe Flash Catalyst and Flash Builder.</li>
</ul>
