<h3>Background Info:</h3>
</div>

	When I joined Miso, I was given the project of creating our first ever SideShow Creation Tool. A Miso SideShow is a iPhone slideshow created by a user with individual pieces of content (cards) tagged to specific times in an episode of television. These cards must contain at least one image along with some text. </p> 

	<p>Check out <a href="http://www.gomiso.com/">Miso's homepage</a> for some SideShow examples on the web.</p>

	<p>My first task was taking the creation process from an Excel Spreadsheet to a bare minimum web interface that could be implemented by engineering in two weeks. This iteration was extremely basic, but it tackled the crucial needs of allowing image upload, card category selection, and more traditional text entry. </p>

<h3>The Research:</h3>
</div>
The subsequent iterations were heavily influenced by user research. I spent the next 2 weeks observing all of our “TV Superfans” creating SideShows with our tool so I could tease out the problem areas. </p>

<p>Organizing my findings on Post-it notes helped me identify the top user pain points:</p>
<div id="post">
<ol>
	<li>Difficult to find the right image for a card</li>
	<li>No ability to crop/resize an image within the tool</li>
	<li>No ability to preview cards before publishing a SideShow</li>
	<li>Users often drop off before publishing an entire SideShow</li>
<ol>
</div>

<h3>Sketching and Wireframing:</h3>
</div>
<!-->
Keeping the problem areas in mind, I created a flow diagram of all the possible steps that a user could take in the tool. Then I kicked off brainstorming by evaluating all the opportunities that I had to minimize the number of steps necessary.

<p>Initial Brainstorming Sketches:</p>

<p>After presenting a wide array of design options to product management and engineering, we were able to narrow down to an approach that all the stakeholders were happy with. I proceeded to create detailed interaction specifications to iron out all the remaining kinks in the experience. </p>

<h3>Final Product</h3>
</div>

Once detailed interaction specs were complete, I tackled visuals based on the existing creative direction for Miso. The final product ended up looking like this: </p>

<P>I was able to address all of my goals in the following ways:<p>
