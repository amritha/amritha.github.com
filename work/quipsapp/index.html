<p><h3>Background Info:</h3>
</div>
After a period of beta testing and user testing, we decided to completely redesign the product. This time we wanted to center on the concept of commenting on "moments" of television and sharing these moments out with friends. The new quip was focused entirely on the screenshot from a television episode with a user's commentary overlayed on top of the image: </p>

<p><h3>Sketching and Wireframing:</h3>
</div>
I worked with the product manager to create a site flow diagram in order to map out all the different screens and states we would need for the new version of the app. It was a great way to further detail out the product requirements before diving into the design of the actual app.

For each concept I would sketch a variety of options. Working in a "war room" style fashion, I would quickly finalize design directions with product management and engineering before proceeding to wireframes.

Once a direction was finalized, I would create a detailed set of interaction specifications using Adobe Illustrator. After this was complete, I worked closely with engineering to make sure they had everything they needed to begin implementation. I also worked closely with the visual designer to smoothly transition the wireframes to high fidelity mockups.
