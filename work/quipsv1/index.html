The <a href="/work/eggdrop">SideShow creation tool</a> did not get the chance to launch because Miso pivoted and wanted to streamline towards an entirely mobile experience. Instead of entire SideShows being created by users on the web, we wanted users to create individual text-based “quips” on their iPhones: </p>

<h3>Sketching and Wireframing:</h3>
</div>
I began by sketching out all sorts of layouts for the creation screen itself.</p>
<img width="100%", src="/images/QuipSketch.png" alt="" />

<p>A big challenge was figuring out how to adapt the image search flow for a mobile experience. The goals in this case were slightly different from the Web SideShow Creation Tools:</p>
<div id="post">
<ol>
	<li>Provide a simple way for users to upload or find a photo on the iPhone.</li>
	<li>Accelerate image search flow through prompting.</li>
	<li>Provide a simple way to scan a large amount of image search results.</li>
	<li>Allow a preview of the full image before selection.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>I outlined a straightforward user flow and proceeded to simplify it from there. I benchmarked other mobile apps like Google Image Search and Photobucket for inspiration. </p>

<p> After a multiple iterations on my sketches, I created wireframes to finalize the interactions. </p>

<p>After making sure all details were ironed out for engineering implementation, I set forth on the visuals based on the existing creative direction.</p>

<P>I was able to tackle all of my goals in the following ways:<p>
	<div class="cube">
<table width="100%">
	<tr></tr>
	<td width="50%">
	<p style="text-align:center">Simple upload from creation screen</p>
	<img width="100%" src="/images/QuipCube1.png" alt="" />
	</td>
	<td width="50%">
	
	<p style="text-align:center">Search suggestions based on TV Show</p>

	<tr>
		<td width="50%">
			<p style="text-align:center">Grid of search results for easy scanning</p>
	<img width="100%" src="/images/QuipCube3.png" alt="" />

		<td width="50%">
			<p style="text-align:center">Full image preview before selection</p>
	<img width="100%" src="/images/QuipCube4.png" alt="" />

	</tr>
