My research methods included hosting individual interviews, conducting focus groups, and obtaining user written TV Journals. Here is a representation of some of the content found in the study:  </p>

<p>I wrote a blog post about the entire process and findings for this project on the Miso blog. You can read it <a href="http://blog.gomiso.com/2012/04/19/tv-watching-is-not-passive/">here. </a></p>
