<h3>Summary:</h3>
</div>
For fun, I built a quirky side project with a friend called ILoveYouSF.com. It is a spin on Craigslistâ€™s Missed Connections and was concepted and designed from scratch by us. I took it upon myself to learn some Ruby on Rails to build the backend framework. I did some front end work too by visually designing and implementing the "About" page.</p>

<p>The website is still live, so feel free to visit it and contribute (<a href="http://iloveyousf.com">www.iloveyousf.com</a>). Also, I wrote a blog post about our product decision-making process and overall experience with this project that you can read <a href="http://amrithaprasad.com/2012/09/28/announcing-iloveyousfcom/">here.</a> </p>
