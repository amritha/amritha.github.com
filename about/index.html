		<p>I'm currently a Product Designer at Miso, dwelling more in the Interaction Design and User Research end of things. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 2010 with a double major in Information Systems and Human Computer Interaction. Lately I've been forcing myself to get better with code, so I utilized Jekyll to build this blog. </p>

		<h3>Things to know about me</h3>
		<ul>

			<li>I cannot function without a cup of coffee in the morning. Period.</li>
			<li>I'm a social media addict that isn't trying very hard to reform myself.</li>
			<li>Death Cab for Cutie is my favorite band. </li>
