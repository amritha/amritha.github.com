		<p>I am a Product Designer at <a href="http://www.uber.com">Uber</a> dwelling more in the User Experience side of things. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 2010 with a double major in Information Systems and Human Computer Interaction. Lately, I've been forcing myself to learn how to code, so I utilized <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> to build this website. </p>

		<p>The best way to reach me is via email (
<a href="mailto:amrithap27@gmail.com">amrithap27@gmail.com</a>) or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/amrithap">twitter</a>. You can also check out my <a href="http://www.dribbble.com/amrithap">dribbble</a> and <a href="http://www.github.com/amritha">github</a>.
