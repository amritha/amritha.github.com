		<p>I'm currently a Product Designer at Miso, dwelling more in the Interaction Design and <a href="http://blog.gomiso.com/2012/04/19/tv-watching-is-not-passive/">User Research</a> end of things. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 2010 with a double major in Information Systems and Human Computer Interaction. Lately I've been forcing myself to learn how to code, so I utilized Jekyll to build this blog. </p>
