<p>Hello, I am Amritha. I tend to talk a lot, laugh at inappropriate times, and make terrible puns. <a href="http://www.jekyllbootstrap.com">Jekyll Bootstrap</a> is awesome, and I wanted to try it out for myself with this site. I can't really say I've figured out exactly what I want to blog about, but I can say it will be a mix of the following: general thoughts on product design, my n00b journey through the world of programming, tidbits of my work, personal revelations, and all kinds of general mischief. </p>
<p> PS I'll get to styling this thing eventually, but for now I just want to write. </p>
