<b>An Introduction To My Bollywood Addiction</b>

<p>Strangely enough, I've always bucketed my life into segments based on Bollywood movie release dates. It's actually bizarre. Call me superstitious, but everytime that I eagerly anticipate a new big budget film, my reaction to it seems to dictate my overall outlook on life until the next one releases. If that's any indication, I must say that I've found myself in quite the funk for the past 9 months when both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra.One">Ra.One</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_(2012_film)">Cocktail</a> turned out to be absolutely horrid. Finally, a new movie came on my radar called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZxrao3zou4">Barfi</a> which stars the man of my dreams, Ranbir Kapoor. Once the positive reviews came flooding in, I knew that I needed to see it in theaters come what may. It appeared to be just what I needed to get out of my life rut.</p>

<b>Things Did Not Go As Planned </b>  
<p>I set up a time with my good friend/bollywood buddy, Alok, to drive us to Union City for a Saturday night showing. I purposely picked Saturday night because I had resolved to be kinder to my liver and stay under the radar on big party nights. Things were going great on the ride up! We were catching up, laughing about dumb things, until... BAM. Just like that, one of his tires burst, and we were stranded on the side of the highway without a spare tire to boot. </p>

<p>Hours of misery ensued. While waiting for AAA to pick us up, we desperately tried to find any place where we could buy a single tire. There HAD to be some way to salvage the night, right? Alas, it appeared not because we were repeatedly hung up on by nasty car service operators. Saturday at 8 PM was the absolute worst time for something like this to have happened.</p> 

<b>I Wasn't Quite Ready To Give Up</b>

<p>As the tow truck started taking us back to San Francisco, an irrational feeling of desperation came over me. It had been a crappy, stressful week. Hell, it had been a crappy, stressful year, and I needed something to bring the spring back in my step. I wanted to take fate into my own hands and prove that I could overcome the night's misfortunes. I was determined to make it to this movie and enjoy it, damn it. I immediately proceeded to tweet and text all of my friends to see if there was some way that I could borrow a car just for the night. Most people ignored me, and one close friend even texted me back with: </p>

<em>"There are many services for that. I am not one of them."</em>

<p>...And that's when I snapped. Really? Is that how human beings respond to requests for help nowadays? I turned over to Alok and told him that we were going to drink immediately. If the universe really didn't want me to deviate from my typical Saturday night activities, so be it. </p>

<b>Fate Surprised Me Yet Again</b>
<p>We dragged our dejected selves to a pretentious dive bar in the Mission and proceeded to scowl while we ordered beers. Just when all hope was lost, I received a Twitter Direct Message. Someone that I had only met a handful of times had just offered me his car for the evening! My jaw dropped. After hours and hours of hating everything, it's like the world was throwing me a bone. It was probably one of the kindest gestures that anyone had shown me in a very long time. </p>

<p>Oddly enough, I wanted to deny the offer and continue to wallow. I was comfortably in "life sucks" mode, and I didn't want to be proven wrong. Just when I was about to draft the "Thanks so much, but I'm OK" message back, I realized that I had become so jaded and bitter in recent times that I almost <em>wanted</em> to stay miserable. Perpetually feeling lost in this huge, cutthroat city had been causing me to ignore good things when I encountered them. I decided right then and there to end this vicious cycle.</p>

<p>Before I knew it, I was already out the door trying to hail a cab so I could pick up the car and get to this freaking movie. We gunned it to the movie theater and made it just in time for the last showing at 10:45 PM. We won. </p>

<p>The movie ended up being totally worth it (I could go on for hours with a review, but I'll spare you). More than anything, it proved to me that life can often pleasantly surprise you, despite how jaded you might be. I have a feeling that this will be a good couple of months. </p>
