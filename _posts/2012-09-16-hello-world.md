<p>Hello, I am Amritha. I came to the realization that my identity is split up all over the internet across various blogs that represent different aspects of my personality. So I thought to myself... Wouldn't it be nice to try and consolidate my ramblings to one blog? 
Besides, <a href="jekyllbootstrap.com">Jekyll Bootstrap</a> is awesome, and I wanted to try it out. I can't really say I've figured out exactly what I want to blog about, but I can say it will be a mix of the following: personal revelations, documenting my journey of learning how to program, general thoughts on product design, tidbits of my work, and all kinds of general mischief. </p>
<p> PS I'll get to styling this thing eventually, but for now I just want to write. </p>
