title: "Another Lesson That I Learned from a Bollywood Film: English Vinglish"

---

<p>It's been a hat trick for me because the last three Bollywood films that I've seen have been absolutely amazing. Post my <a href="http://amrithaprasad.com/2012/09/19/not-your-typical-saturday-night.html">almost misadventure</a> with Barfi, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fivOhPjX9YM">Student of the Year</a> proved to be the illogical, "old school" Bollywood romance that I've been craving for years (I HIGHLY recommend it to any fellow Bollywood fans). And then came the return of yesteryear Bollywood heroine, Sridevi, in a more mainstream film titled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Vinglish">English Vinglish</a>.</p>

<p>The plot was extremely simple. An Indian housewife, subtly ridiculed by her husband and children for her inability to speak English, secretly takes English classes during the weeks leading up to her niece's wedding. The film culminates with her giving a speech entirely in English during the wedding reception in front of her entire extended family. I must say, I was absolutely floored by how heartfelt and insightful this speech was. It displayed more wisdom and thoughtfulness than most  English speakers have expressed in their entire lifetime. I wanted to elaborate on two points that she made specifically that particularly resonated with me. Also, in case you're curious, you can watch the speech <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqApGeA7rp8">here</a>.  </p>

<b>Understanding Healthy Relationships</b>
</div>

<em>This marriage is the most beautiful thing. It is the most special friendship. The friendship of two people who are equal.</em>

<p>The simplicity of this definition blew my mind and aligns greatly with how I view marriage. I've had disagreements with close friends in the past who have entered relationships, even marriages, thinking that such bonds are the best when a couple becomes "one unit." By this "one unit" business, I'm referring to the couple that we all know... They do everything together and don't really seem to have a life or any friends of their own anymore. I don't think I could ever survive in a relationship in which I didn't have my own distinct identity. I think of relationships as a very special kind of friendship which implies a pact between two people, not an agreement to become one completely in sync human being. I subscribe to the idea of "opposites attract" because the beauty of it is that there are certain unique attributes of each person that complement the other. The inherent differences between the two halves is what makes the relationship strong and worth having. </p>

<p>I also loved her emphasis on equality, which I don't even think of as a gender-specific thing. I just believe that when you enter a relationship with someone, you should treat them as your equal in every way possible. Whether it's in terms of intelligence, social status, attractiveness, or anything really... Uplift that person and make them feel like you respect them wholeheartedly. </p>

<b>Actively Fighting Your Insecurities</b>
</div>

<em>Sometimes married people don't know how the other is feeling. Does that mean the marriage is over? No, that means you have to help yourself. If you do that, you will return back feeling equal. </em>

<p>This to me, was the most beautiful insight that she shared. Even if you end up feeling unequal or generally unhappy in a relationship, do NOT blame the other person and expect them to make things better for you. First focus on improving yourself. Then you will often find that your personal relationships will feel stronger once you start to actually love yourself. </p>

<p>I think the premise of the entire movie hinges on this concept. Sure the film could have chosen to villainize her husband and children for making fun of her poor English, but this is honestly a very common occurence. Whether it's English, sports, or even the ability to code, there will always be people who make you feel insecure about what they don't think you are capable of. Often times, it might even be those closest to you. The best way to deal with it is not to villainize them, but to focus on your insecurities and start confronting them head on. That is the only way you can continue to build your self respect and self confidence over time. </p>

<p>I challenge you to look inside yourself and identify that demon that makes you feel like you're just not good enough. I then want you to resolve to confront this somehow in an actionable manner and see what happens. It could change the course of your life. </p>
