title: "Being Facebook Friends with my Dad"

---

<p>For the vast majority of my life, I went to great lengths to avoid letting my parents see anything and everything that I posted on the Internet. I didn't want them to know anything about my life because I saw them as the strict Indian parents that never wanted me to stay out past 10 PM or hang out with boys. However, somehow as I grew older, my parents became less like the authority figures I feared, and more like the nagging best friends I never had. My mom offers unwavering emotional support for every life situation imaginable and my dad is an all-around awesome guy that seriously doesn't judge anything I do. </p>

<p>(Note: My little sister, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/deepap">Deepa</a>, is also the best friend anyone could ever ask for. This entry just has nothing to do with her, sorry little one)</p>

<p>Having developed such a close rapport with my family, it was a tough decision to move from the East Coast to the West Coast a few years ago. My parents definitely felt a sense of paranoia knowing that they couldn't know every single detail about my life by being so far away. My mom resorted to calling me three times a day, EVERYDAY (this has not diminished at all over the years). My dad, however, had a sneakier approach. He assumed the identity of "Viji Prasad," a name that my mom often goes by, and sent me a friend request. I hesitantly accepted and put this sketchy account on the "Limited Profile" setting. </p>
<p> He definitely put on a good show by posting pictures of mom and corresponding with her friends like it was actually her. Trust me, he wasn't fooling anyone. Deepa and I definitely knew it was our old man the entire time.</p>
<p>One day, he even confronted me and wanted to know if I could just let him see everything I posted. Since he clearly had better things to do than Facebook stalk me all day, he didn't like the idea of me intentionally hiding things from him. It didn't seem like an unfair request, so I proceeded to give him what he wanted. </p>

<div class="lemphasis"><b>He Wasn't Very Good at Hiding How Much He Stalked</b></div>

<p>I think he tried to play it off at first, but it became obvious that he definitely spent a significant amount of his spare time Facebook stalking me. In our occasional phone calls and video chats, he would say things like "You were looking very cute in that blue dress last night!" or "How was your party? I saw only 5 people RSVPed, you loser!" </p>
<p>While things like this made me toy with the idea of blocking him, I had to admit that it was pretty funny. He seemed to get a kick out of everything he saw, and it certainly livened up our catch-up conversations. By seeing all the content I was sharing, he seemed to have a much better grasp on my evolving interests and daily life. We became closer because he didn't have to waste time opening conversations with "What did you do today?" or "Where did you eat?" He would just cut to the chase and make fun of the things I intentionally (and unintentionally) posted.</p>

<div class="lemphasis"><b>My Dad, My Biggest Fan</b></div>

<p>Once my dad started making his own friends on Facebook, I noticed that he liked to use social media to publicize my exploits and accomplishments. He'd share blog posts that I wrote and posted on my timeline. He would encourage people to sign up for Miso (the startup I worked at) via his Facebook statuses. I noticed that he made sure to like the Uber Facebook page as soon as I started working there. Anything that I did, he loved to share it out to his network so he could show how proud he was of me.</p>

<p>The absolute best was when someone wrote a nasty comment on a blog entry that I co-wrote with my friend, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/sabrina">Sabrina</a>, and he jumped in to defend us:

<p>In this day and age, Internet loyalty like that is impossible to find!</p>

<div class="lemphasis"><b>It's Like We Never Missed a Beat</b></div>

<p>Over time I feel like Facebook has become an integral part of how I interact with my dad. I've even started to notice that his Spotify history will often exactly mirror the songs that I was just listening to. It's these new and hilarious use cases I consistently discover that make my heart melt. Without being around, he has managed to keep in sync with me despite my tumultuous transition into adulthood.</p>

<p>People are always complaining about Facebook privacy issues and how social media is gradually cheapening our daily experiences. Don't get me wrong, I definitely have my share of grievances. But I have to say, I have a hard time hating any service that has managed to facillitate a deeper (and funnier) relationship with my dad despite the thousands of miles that separate us.</p>
