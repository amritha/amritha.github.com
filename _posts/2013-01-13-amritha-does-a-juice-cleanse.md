title: "Amritha does a Juice Cleanse"

---

<p>So I decided to do a 3 day juice cleanse to kick off my New Year. I could bore you with all the reasons why one should do something like this, but honestly I was just curious. After seeing this <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/detoxing-tips">Refinery29 article</a>, I decided to go with the <a href="http://www.cancancleanse.com"> CanCan Cleanse</a> because they are conveniently located in the Mission district. </p>

<p>I was about to embark on a diet that consisted solely of 8 juices a day. Bring it on.</p>

<div class="lemphasis"><b>What was it like?</b></div>

<p><span class="lemphasis"><b>Day 1:</b></span> The first day was pretty fun! I actually liked the taste of all the juices (even the dreaded green juice mix). I felt like by the time I finished one juice, I was due for my next after an hour, so I never felt hungry. Starting at 3 PM, I felt a light headache coming on, so I e-mailed the cleanse specialist, and she told me I could ease my headaches by having some peppermint tea. That worked wonders. All was well as I drifted off into a deep sleep that night for 10 hours. </p>

<p><span class="lemphasis"><b>Day 2:</b></span> I woke up with terrible dark circles under my eyes. I checked my instagram and Iimmediately began to hate anyone who thought it was a good idea to post a picture of their breakfast sandwich or bagel. I had to hypnotize myself into thinking about ANYTHING other than eggs on the bus ride to work. While I was sitting at my desk, my head was pounding, and I managed to squeak out a "No, thanks" while all my coworkers left for lunch. I decided to e-mail the cleanse specialist and find out if there was anything at all I could eat. She told me that I could cheat the cleanse with a few small sticks of celery. I chewed on my celery sticks and scowled all day. I came home and my wireless was out, so I got into what I thought was a completely warranted argument with a tech support representative and passed out around 9. </p>

<p><span class="lemphasis"><b>Day 3:</b></span> It was just like the introduction of a heroine in a Bollywood film (No seriously, I'm not even joking. Watch the first minute of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zozb-V0y3v8">this video</a> for an accurate reenactment). I woke up with an inexplicable grin on my face, and my skin was radiant. I had more energy than I had felt in a very long time and I barely thought about what it would be like to eat food the next day. All I could think was, "is this what it feels like when you don't have a bunch of crap inside your body?" My day went swimmingly, and I fell asleep watching "Something's Gotta Give."</p>

<div class="lemphasis"><b>Was it worth it?</b></div>

<p>It's been a few days since, and I legitimately feel like someone has hit the reset button on my body. Going on this cleanse made me extremely aware of what I was putting in my body, and I now think twice before eating something unhealthy. I seem to only crave salads, pastas, and fruit plates. The idea of drinking any kind of alcohol repulses me. Also it might be entirely in my head, but I actually got a caffeine kick from drinking my first cup of coffee!</p>

<p>More importantly, I feel happy. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I've felt eerily peaceful since the cleanse. If you know me, I'm quite excessive in every way. I eat a lot, I drink a lot, I talk a lot, I socialize... A LOT. To spend 3 days essentially in isolation (so much social activity revolves around food and drink!!) and having to say no to everything and everyone around me was a difficult but liberating experience. </p>

<p>I wouldn't say a juice cleanse is everyone's cup of tea. I wouldn't even say that I'd necessarily do it again. I'm just grateful for its detox effects and how it has motivated me to take better care of myself as I begin 2013. Let's hope that the good habits stick.  </p>
