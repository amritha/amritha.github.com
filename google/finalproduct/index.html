	<p>Final Wireframes</p></div>

<p> After sketching out various options, I created wireframes for the concept that I decided upon. I named the product KitchenMate.</p>

<p><div class="emphasis">
<h3>1. KitchenMate's Location</h3>
</div>
KitchenMate is a tablet-sized device built into the kitchen's Island area between the two placemats for eating.</p>

<img src="/images/google/KitchenMateLocation.png" width="100%"></a>
<p><div class="emphasis">
<h3>2. Home Screen</h3>
</div>
Mom can see this week's and next week's grocery lists on the KitchenMate home screen. The upcoming week's list will become this week's list at 12 AM every Sunday.</p>
<img src="/images/google/KitchenHome.png" width="100%"></a> 
<div id="post">
		<ul>
			
			<li><b>2.1</b> Items that don't recur float to the top of the list for higher emphasis. </li>
			<li><b>2.2</b> Recurring items are visually indicated with a different background color.</li>
			<li><b>2.3</b> User can check off items by tapping in the checkbox area upon which the item is added to the top of the list of checked off items. Tapping on the checkbox again can uncheck the item and return it back to the pending items section. </li>
			<li><b>2.4</b> User can toggle between this weeks grocery list and next weekâ€™s. </li>
		</ul>
</div>

<p><div class="emphasis">
<h3>3. Add Item</h3>
</div>
Mom can add multiple items to the this week's or next week's grocery list by hitting the giant + button.</p>
<img src="/images/google/KitchenAdd.png" width="100%"></a> 
<div id="post">
		<ul>
			
			<li><b>3.1</b> User can type in item name. </li>
			<li><b>3.2</b> User can choose to indicate that this item recurs weekly by tapping on the checkbox. </li>
			<li><b>3.3</b> Tapping on "Add Another Item" allows the user to add multiple items in one screen. Tapping it causes another set of input fields to appear below the existing one. </li>
			<li><b>3.4</b> Once the user starts typing, they can clear the contents of the field by tapping the "x."</li>
			<li><b>3.5</b> Hitting "Done" adds these items to the list that the user tapped the "+" from.</li>
		</ul>
</div>

<p><div class="emphasis">
<h3>4. Edit Item</h3>
</div>
Mom wants to make sure that Milk is no longer a recurring item. She can do this by tapping on the Milk item in her list to take her to the edit screen.</p>
<img src="/images/google/KitchenEdit.png" width="100%"></a> 
<div id="post">
		<ul>
			
			<li><b>4.1</b> Once user taps on an item, they are taken to the edit screen. Here they can change the name of the item or alter whether it is a recurring item or not.</li>
			<li><b>4.2</b> User can also choose to delete this item upon which they are taken back to the list that they came from.</li>
			
		</ul>
</div>

<p><div class="emphasis">
<h3>5. Synced with Phone</h3>
</div>
Dad decides to glance over the list in the kitchen before he leaves home. When he's about to check out at the grocery store, he quickly takes a look at the list again on the KitchenMate mobile app.</p>
<img src="/images/google/KitchenSync.png" width="100%"></a> 

<p><div class="emphasis">
<h3>6. Leaving Notes</h3>
</div>
Mom wants to leave a note for Kid that reminds Kid to take her antibiotics. Once she leaves the note, the indicator flashes to get Kid's attention.</p>
<img src="/images/google/KitchenNote.png" width="100%"></a> 
<div id="post">
		<ul>
			
			<li><b>6.1</b> Tapping on the "Post a Note" button on the Home screen allows the user to input a note.  </li>
			<li><b>6.2</b> On hitting post, the note is posted as an overlay over the grocery list. The light indicator will flash to indicate there is an unread note.</li>
			<li><b>6.3</b> Upon hitting ok, the note disappears and the indicator stops flashing. </li>
			<li><b>Note:</b> Notes feature is not available on KitchenMate mobile app because KitchenMate notes are intended to be consumed in the kitchen.</li>
			
		</ul>
</div>

<p><div class="emphasis">
<h3>Future Considerations</h3>
</div></p>

<div id="post">
		<ul>
			
			<li>It would be great to test this product out with many other families to see if this fulfills any of their needs. </li>
			<li>Will families want more robust note management? Or is a transient announcement enough?</li>
			<li>Will users have any confusion keeping up with whether they are on this week's or the upcoming's week list? </li>
			<li>How will kitchen behavior change in this family because of this device? </li>
			<li>Will any other pain points emerge now that grocery list management has become slightly easier?</li>

			
		</ul>
</div>
