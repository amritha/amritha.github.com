<p>This is my proposed solution to the Google Design Exercise. I chose the first prompt: </p>

<p><em>Family households today are often very chaotic places.  Parents and children are coming and going at various times.  There are chores that need to be done.  Menus need to be planned, groceries need to be purchased, and meals need to be cooked.  Everyone wants to chip in and help, but it can be challenging coordinating everything.  Many times the kitchen ends up being the central point of interaction. Design an interface that a modern family can use in that space to orchestrate their busy lives.</em></p>
