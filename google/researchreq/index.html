<h3>Creating Requirements</h3>
</div>

Since I am not the target user of a product like this one, I decided that the best way to get perspective on this problem would be to interview a family about their kitchen usage. This was a great way to inform the requirements for this product and help me get into what a family's needs would be. For the sake of time, I only interviewed one family, and you can see the detailed interview transcript <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H6TOWoPPifCiqtVitLsVGHEKEOQU9u_m_UPes_isRco/edit">here</a>.

<h3>Who Did I Talk To? </h3>
</div>

I talked to a suburban, upper middle class, family in Philadelphia. The father is 55 years old and is a Project Manager in the pharmaceutical space. The mother is 48 years old and is an Account Manager at PNCBank. The couple's daughter is a sophomore in college and comes back every 1-2 months to visit, but typically doesn't participate in any household chores.

<h3>What Were the Pain Points and Opportunities? </h3>
</div>
My interpretation of the research data surfaced the following notable findings that I wanted to address in the design: </p>
<div id="post">
		<ul>
			<li><span class="lemphasis"><b>Chore Management is Understood</b></span> In this household, there's a general understanding of who does what chores, so chore management isn't actually a pain point. These chores occur regularly every Sunday with Mom completing certain chores and Dad completing others. Dad goes grocery shopping for the week every Sunday. </li>
			<li><span class="lemphasis"><b>The Island</b></span> Most kitchen activity seems to be centered around the Island area pictured above. It is where notes/grocery lists are left, where meals are usually prepared, and where most meals are consumed.</li>
			<li><span class="lemphasis"><b>Grocery list Management</b></span> The biggest pain point for Mom is coordinating with Dad to make sure all the needed items are purchased every Sunday. Because he typically forgets to grab the list and leaves home without it, he often will forget an item or two leading him to have to make another trip during the week. When he does take the list with him, he typically uses it to doublecheck that he didn't forget anything at the end of the trip. He doesn't like to keep the list out while he's grocery shopping. </li>
			<li><span class="lemphasis"><b>Recurring Items</b></span> Items on the grocery list often repeat on a weekly basis. This shows an opportunity to speed up the grocery list creation process by preloading it with commonly listed items.</li>
			<li><span class="lemphasis"><b>Casual Notes</b></span> There seems to be a playful interaction between family members when notes are left on the Island. These notes could be from Mom to Dad to express that she needs something mailed. Mom could be reminding Kid to take vitamins or medication. These notes are typically transient and are almost always thrown away upon reading. Also sometimes notes are missed in a hurry, so it would be nice if there was a way to draw more attention to them.</li>
			<li><span class="lemphasis"><b>Smart Phones</b></span> Dad and daughter both have a smart phone, but mom does not. </li>
			
		</ul>
