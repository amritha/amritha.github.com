<h3>Initial Brainstorming</h3>
</div>

After gathering goals, I spent eight minutes sketching out a different idea per minute. Without any pressure to fully develop any ideas yet, it was a great way to get the creative juices flowing and come up with a few ideas to kick things off. </p>

<p> From this brainstorming, I concluded that I wanted to create some sort of touch screen device that was located in the Island area of the kitchen. The next step was to create some User Scenarios that would help me understand how the family would use this device.</p>

<p><div class="emphasis">
<h3>User Scenarios</h3>
</div>

I decided to create storyboards to iron out how I imagined the family using the device in their everyday lives.</p>

1. <span class="lemphasis"><b>Scenario 1</b></span> Mom is creating grocery list for Dad during the week

2. <span class="lemphasis"><b>Scenario 2</b></span> Mom is leaving Kid a reminder to take her medication in the morning when she wakes up.

<p>I realized for the grocery shopping story it would be important to have some sort of syncing with a smartphone device to alleviate the pain point of Dad often forgetting the list at home. </p>

<p>After mapping out the note-leaving scenario, I realized it might be a bit bulky to have an entire notes section in the product because these notes are intended to be viewed once then discarded. </p>

<h3>UI Sketches</h3>
</div>

<p>I decided to organize lists on a weekly basis and have them reset every Sunday (this could be reconfigured if necessary). This meant that there had to be a way to see the list for the current week in case there were any straggler items to pick up during the week. But more importantly, the list for the upcoming week had to be easily accessible so Dad could grab that list on his weekly Sunday grocery shopping trip.</p>

<p> I started by sketching out the main list interface for the touch screen device on the Island. I wanted there to be an easy way to edit items after creation with an indicator of whether the item is recurring weekly or not. After experimenting with nobs and edit buttons, I realized the easiest way to edit an item would be by simply tapping on the name.</p>

<p> Then I sketched out what the add item and edit screens could look like. I ended up coming up with a concept called "Add another" that could speed up the creation of grocery lists for Mom.</p>

<p>I then began to reimagine how the Home Screen would look with the inclusion of the Notes feature and Settings feature</p>

<p> Finally, I decided that the Notes feature would function best as an announcement-like overlay on top of the core application. The device could have an indicator that blinks when a note has been left. </p>
